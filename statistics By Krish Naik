VARIABLES : A variable is a property that can take on any value. 
Ex- Height : 182,178,168,150, 160,170
    Weight : 78,86,99, 100, 60, 68

Two types of Variable:
   a) Quantitative Variable: Measured numerically (add, subs, multi[ly, divide)
            Two types: 
                      1) Discrete (whole number, no. of bank accounts, no. of students) 
                      2) Continuous (Height : 172.4, 160.7, 163.9 or Weight : 100, 99.5, 99.75)

   b) Qualitative Variable : Based on some characteristocs we can define categorical variables. Ex: Gender(male & female).

VARAIBLE MEASUREMENT SCALES
1) Nominal: (Categorical data -> color, gender, type of flower)
2) Ordinal : we focus more on the order, rank not on actual values. Ex: Rank of students not marks
3) Interval : Order matters, value matters. (10-20, 20-30....)
4) Ratio : 

# Population (N): mean(mu)
# Sample (n): mean(X Bar)


CENTERAL TENDENCY
1) MEAN
2) Median
3) MODE

MEASURE OF DISPERSION (Dispersion = Spread)
1) VARIANCE
2 Standard Deviation

PERCENTILE AND QUARTILE (Find Outliers)
1) PERCENTILE:  is a vlaue below which a certain percentage of obs. lies
   Formula : (# of values below x)/n * 100
2) Quartile: opposite of percentile
   Formula : (Percentile)/100 * (n+1)

FIVE NUMBER SUMMARY (BOX PLOT)
1) Minimum
2) First Quartile (Q1)
3) Median
4) Third Quartile(Q3)
5) Maximum

OUTLIER DETECTION AND REMOVAL

Ex: {1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,8,9,27}
[Lower Fence <-> Higher Fence]

Lower fence = Q1-1.5(IQR)
Higher Fence = Q3 + 1.5(IQR)

IQR= Q3 - Q1

Q1(25%) = 25/100*(19+1) =  5th => 3
Q3(75%) = 75/100*(19+1) =  15th => 7
i.e, IQR = 4

Lower fence = 3- 1.5(4) = -1
Higher fence = 7 + 1.5(4) = 13

So, outlier will bwe removed

1) Minimum = 1
2) First Quartile (Q1) = 3
3) Median = 5
4) Third Quartile(Q3) = 7
5) Maximum = 9
This is waht we call BOX PLOT


ADVANCE STATISTICS
1) distribution: 
a) Normal Distribution 
b) Standard Normal Distribution
c) Z score
d) log Normal distribution
e) bernoulli distribution
f) binomial distribution


1) Distribution:
Ages= {24,26,27,25,32,33,32......}

a) Gaussian/ normal distrubution

# Bell curve: from middle part of the bell curve both the parts will be equal in terms of amount of data (right and left part)
ex: mean, median & mode

in a bell curve: A). between the 1st S.D, 68% of the data will be present. 
                 B). between the 2st S.D, 95% of the data will be present.
                 C). between the 3st S.D, 99.7% of the data will be present.
Emperical formula: 68 - 95- 99.7% Rule

Ex: Height, weight, iris dataset(petal length, sepal length)

Ex: s= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
mean = 4, S.D= 1
Where does 4.5 fall in terms of S.D

Sol: after makin the bell curve, we can go further in number line according to S.D

c). Z score: help i finding that how much away an number is from mean
formula: (x - mean)/S.d

Zscore also helps in finding to get the standard deviation.
Zscore of sample => {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}

Therefore, this process is also called as STANDARDISATION(part of feature scaling)

Now in normalization(-1 to 1): Minmax Scaler
in CNN(image classification) we can use normalisation.

Zscore also helps in finding area of a bell curve.

DAY:4
1) IQR- python
2) Probability
3) PnC
4)confidence intervals
5) p values
6) hypothesis testing

2) Probability: is a measure of the liklihood of the event
ex: rolling a dice

Addition Rule (Probability, "or")

#Mutual Exclusive event: two wvwnts are Mutual Exclusive if they cannpot occur at the same time
ex: rolling a dice, tossing a coin

#non-Mutual Exclusive: multiple events can occuyr at the same time.
Ex: deck of cards.

Que: If I toss a coin, what is the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails?
Sol: p(A or B) = P(AP +P(B)
               = 1/2+1/2= 1

Que: randomly picking a card, what is the probability of chooshing a card that is queen or a heart?
Sol: p(Q)= 4/52
     p(heart) = 13/52
     p(Q abd Heart) = 1/52

p(Q or heart) = p(Q) + p(Heart) - p(Q & HEArt)
              = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52
