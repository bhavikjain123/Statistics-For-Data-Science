VARIABLES : A variable is a property that can take on any value. 
Ex- Height : 182,178,168,150, 160,170
    Weight : 78,86,99, 100, 60, 68

Two types of Variable:
   a) Quantitative Variable: Measured numerically (add, subs, multi[ly, divide)
            Two types: 
                      1) Discrete (whole number, no. of bank accounts, no. of students) 
                      2) Continuous (Height : 172.4, 160.7, 163.9 or Weight : 100, 99.5, 99.75)

   b) Qualitative Variable : Based on some characteristocs we can define categorical variables. Ex: Gender(male & female).

VARAIBLE MEASUREMENT SCALES
1) Nominal: (Categorical data -> color, gender, type of flower)
2) Ordinal : we focus more on the order, rank not on actual values. Ex: Rank of students not marks
3) Interval : Order matters, value matters. (10-20, 20-30....)
4) Ratio : 

# Population (N): mean(mu)
# Sample (n): mean(X Bar)


CENTERAL TENDENCY
1) MEAN
2) Median
3) MODE

MEASURE OF DISPERSION (Dispersion = Spread)
1) VARIANCE
2 Standard Deviation

PERCENTILE AND QUARTILE (Find Outliers)
1) PERCENTILE:  is a vlaue below which a certain percentage of obs. lies
   Formula : (# of values below x)/n * 100
2) Quartile: opposite of percentile
   Formula : (Percentile)/100 * (n+1)

FIVE NUMBER SUMMARY (BOX PLOT)
1) Minimum
2) First Quartile (Q1)
3) Median
4) Third Quartile(Q3)
5) Maximum

OUTLIER DETECTION AND REMOVAL

Ex: {1,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,8,8,9,27}
[Lower Fence <-> Higher Fence]

Lower fence = Q1-1.5(IQR)
Higher Fence = Q3 + 1.5(IQR)

IQR= Q3 - Q1

Q1(25%) = 25/100*(19+1) =  5th => 3
Q3(75%) = 75/100*(19+1) =  15th => 7
i.e, IQR = 4

Lower fence = 3- 1.5(4) = -1
Higher fence = 7 + 1.5(4) = 13

So, outlier will bwe removed

1) Minimum = 1
2) First Quartile (Q1) = 3
3) Median = 5
4) Third Quartile(Q3) = 7
5) Maximum = 9
This is waht we call BOX PLOT

e) bernoulli distribution
f) binomial distribution


1) Distribution:
Ages= {24,26,27,25,32,33,32......}

a) Gaussian/ normal distrubution

# Bell curve: from middle part of the bell curve both the parts will be equal in terms of amount of data (right and left part)
ex: mean, median & mode

in a bell curve: A). between the 1st S.D, 68% of the data will be present. 
                 B). between the 2st S.D, 95% of the data will be present.
                 C). between the 3st S.D, 99.7% of the data will be present.
Emperical formula: 68 - 95- 99.7% Rule

Ex: Height, weight, iris dataset(petal length, sepal length)

Ex: s= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
mean = 4, S.D= 1
Where does 4.5 fall in terms of S.D

Sol: after makin the bell curve, we can go further in number line according to S.D

c). Z score: help i finding that how much away an number is from mean
formula: (x - mean)/S.d

Zscore also helps in finding to get the standard deviation.
Zscore of sample => {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3}

Therefore, this process is also called as STANDARDISATION(part of feature scaling)

Now in normalization(-1 to 1): Minmax Scaler
in CNN(image classification) we can use normalisation.

Zscore also helps in finding area of a bell curve.

2) Probability
3) PnC
4)confidence intervals
5) p values
6) hypothesis testing

2) Probability: is a measure of the liklihood of the event
ex: rolling a dice

Addition Rule (Probability, "or")

#Mutual Exclusive event: two wvwnts are Mutual Exclusive if they cannpot occur at the same time
ex: rolling a dice, tossing a coin

#non-Mutual Exclusive: multiple events can occuyr at the same time.
Ex: deck of cards.

Que: If I toss a coin, what is the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails?
Sol: p(A or B) = P(AP +P(B)
               = 1/2+1/2= 1

Que: randomly picking a card, what is the probability of choosing a card that is queen or a heart?
Sol: p(Q)= 4/52
     p(heart) = 13/52
     p(Q abd Heart) = 1/52

p(Q or heart) = p(Q) + p(Heart) - p(Q & HEArt).
              = 4/52 + 13/52 - 1/52 = 16/52

Multiplication Rule: in the case of independent or dependent events, we have to solve in different ways.
 Independent events:
                    Ex: rolling a dice{1,2,3,4,5,6}
                        1,2... these are independent events
 dependent events:
                    Ex: taking out marbles from a box.

                   Naive Bayes(conditional probability)


Que: what is the probability of rolling a "5" and then a "4" in a dice?
Sol: multiplication rule:
     P(a & b)= p(a) * P(b) => 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36

Que: what is the probability of drawing a queen and then a aces from a deck of card?
Sol: Dependent event: 
       p(Q) = 4/52, p(A)=4/52
       but, p(A/Q)= 4/51
    therefore, p(Q and A)= 5/52 * 4/51


3) Permutation n Combination

Permutation: nPr= n!/(n-r)!

Combination: nCr= n!/(r! * (n-r)!)

# P-value (very important)
 The p-value is a measure that helps you decide whether to reject the null hypothesis in a hypothesis test. 
It represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

# Low p-value (usually ≤ α): Indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the assumption of the null hypothesis. 
This leads to rejecting the null hypothesis.

# High p-value (> α): Suggests that the observed data is likely under the assumption of the null hypothesis. 
This leads to failing to reject the null hypothesis.

Example:
Suppose you are testing whether a new drug is effective in treating a certain condition:

1) Null Hypothesis (H₀): The new drug has no effect.

2) Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The new drug is effective.

3) Data Collection:
You administer the drug to a group of patients and collect data on their health outcomes.

4) Significance Level (α): Let's choose α = 0.05.

5) Conduct the Test:
Analyze the data using statistical methods to calculate the p-value.

6) Make a Decision:
If the p-value is less than 0.05, you may reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence the drug is effective. 
If the p-value is greater than 0.05, you may fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to claim the drug is effective.

Remember, the p-value is a tool to help you make decisions in the context of hypothesis testing.
It doesn't prove that the null hypothesis is true or false, but it provides a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis.
 
Example: when using the mouse pad, majoirity of times I will touch the center of the mouse pad and there will be less probability that I will touch corners
Like I touch my pad 100-times and i touched center 80 times, then the probabilty of touching the center part will be p(c)= 0.8, and either corner side will be p= 0.1

HYPOTHESIS TESTING:

Ex: toss a coin 100 times, and lets find that is coin is fair or not.

1) NULL hypo.: coin is fair
2) Alternate hypo: coin is unfair.
3) Experiment
4) Reject or accept the null hypo: 

Significant Value(alpha):0.05 (defined by domain expert)

lets say... we got 30times head, will the coin be fair or not?
therefore, it said that our experiment should be near to the mean

=> 1- 0.05 = 0.95 or 95%(confidence interval)
therefore, if the p value comes within the 95% or the confidence interval, then we can say it is fair coin

CHATGPT:
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It involves the following steps:

1) Formulate Hypotheses:
a) Null Hypothesis (H₀): It is a statement of no effect or no difference.
b) Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): It is a statement of an effect or a difference.

2) Collect Data: Gather and analyze a sample from the population.

3) Choose Significance Level (α):The significance level (often denoted by α) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, etc.

4) Conduct the Test: Use statistical methods to evaluate the likelihood of observing the sample data if the null hypothesis were true.

5) Make a Decision:If the p-value (probability value) is less than the chosen significance level, you reject the null hypothesis. If it's greater, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

DAY 5: 

1) Type-1 n Type-2 Error:
 Null hypothesis(Ho)= Coin is fair
Alternative hyposthesis(Hi) = coin is not fair

# reality check: either of the will be true
# Decision: null is true or null is false

Outcome 1: we reject the null hypo, when in reality it is false => YES, it is good decision
Outcome 2: we reject the null hypo, when in reality it is true => TYPE-1 ERROR
           ex: a person is given a death sentence by court, but he is not guilty.(TYPE-1 ERROR) => True Negative
Outcome 3: We accept the null hypothesis, when in reality it is false => TYPE-2 ERROR => False Positive
Outcome 4: We accept the null hypothesis, when in reality it is True => Yes, Good decision

Confusion Matrix:

2) one tail and two test: (video=> 3:20:00)
ex: colleges in karnataka has 85% placement rate. A new college has opened and found that a sample of 150 student had a placement rate of 88%, S.D= 4%. 
a) Does this college has a different placement rate? alpha = 0.05
b)  Does this college has a placement rate greater than 85%?
Sol: 
a) this question has a two tailed test.
b) this question has one tailed test.

3) Confidence Interval: (lets assume alpha = 0.05)
This simply means we have to find both the end values of the interval.

point Estimate: The value of ant stats, that estimates the value of a parameter.

INFERENTIAL STATS.: we will work on samples and based on that, decision will be taken for population
# mean, median or any value of sample can or cannot be same wit the values of population. They can be smaller, higher.

#Confidence interval = (pointer estimate =/- margin of error)

Que: On the quant test of cat exam, the S.D is known to be 100. A sample of 25 test takers has a mean of 520 score.
Construsct a 95% CI about the mean.
Sol: alpha = 0.05, S.D = 100, n = 25, mean= 520
     1) whenever population S.D is given, we apply a test => Z test
        Point Estimate +/- margin of error
        mean + Z(alpha/2)*S.D/(n/2)^1/2
        Upper value= 520 + Z(0.05/2)* 100/(25)^1/2 
                    = 520 + 1.96(20) = 559.2
similarly,lower value = 480.8

When S.D is not given but sample S.D is given, then we use T-test.

Que: On the quant test of cat exam, the sample S.D is known to be 100 and a sample of 25 test takers has a mean of 520 score.
Construsct a 95% CI about the mean.
Sol: alpha = 0.05, Std = 80, n = 25, mean= 520

point estimate +/- margin of error
 upper = 520 + 1.96(20) = 559.2
